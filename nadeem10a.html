<h2>Accuracy-Rejection Curves (ARCs) for Comparing Classification Methods with a Reject Option</h2>

<h3>Abstract</h3>

Data extracted from microarrays are now considered an important source
of knowledge about various diseases. Several studies based on
microarray data and the use of receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) graphs have compared supervised machine learning
approaches. These comparisons are based on classification schemes in
which all samples are classified, regardless of the degree of
confidence associated with the classification of a particular sample
on the basis of a given classifier. In the domain of healthcare, it is
safer to refrain from classifying a sample if the confidence assigned
to the classification is not high enough, rather than classifying all
samples even if confidence is low. We describe an approach in which
the performance of different classifiers is compared, with the
possibility of rejection, based on several reject areas. Using a
tradeoff between accuracy and rejection, we propose the use of
accuracy-rejection curves (ARCs) and three types of relationship
between ARCs for comparisons of the ARCs of two classifiers. Empirical
results based on purely synthetic data, semi-synthetic data (generated
from real data obtained from patients) and public microarray data for
binary classification problems demonstrate the efficacy of this
method.
