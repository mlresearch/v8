title: Evaluation of Signaling Cascades Based on the Weights from Microarray and ChIP-seq
  Data
abstract: In this study, we combined the ChIP-seq and the transcriptome data and integrated
  these data into signaling cascades. Integration was realized through a framework
  based on data- and model-driven hybrid approach. An enrichment model was constructed
  to evaluate signaling cascades which resulted in specific cellular processes. We
  used ChIP-seq and microarray data from public databases which were obtained from
  HeLa cells under oxidative stress having similar experimental setups.  Both ChIP-seq
  and array data were analyzed by percentile ranking for the sake of simultaneous
  data integration on specific genes. Signaling cascades from KEGG pathway database
  were subsequently scored by taking sum of the individual scores of the genes involved
  within the cascade. This scoring information is then transferred to en route of
  the signaling cascade to form the final score. Signaling cascade model based framework
  that we describe in this study is a novel approach which calculates scores for the
  target process of the analyzed signaling cascade, rather than assigning scores to
  gene product nodes.
