title: Evaluation Method for Feature Rankings and their Aggregations for Biomarker
  Discovery
abstract: In this paper we investigate the problem of evaluating ranked lists of biomarkers,
  which are typically an output of the analysis of high-throughput data. This can
  be a list of probes from microarray experiments, which are ordered by the strength
  of their correlation to a disease. Usually, the ordering of the biomarkers in the
  ranked lists varies a lot if they are a result of different studies or methods.
  Our work consists of two parts. First, we propose a method for evaluating the “correctness”
  of the ranked lists. Second, we conduct a preliminary study of different aggregation
  approaches of the feature rankings, like aggregating rankings produced from different
  ranking algorithms and different datasets. We perform experiments on multiple public
  Neuroblastoma microarray studies. Our results show that there is a generally beneficial
  effect of aggregating feature rankings as compared to the ones produced by a single
  study or single method.
