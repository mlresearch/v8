title: Evaluation of a Bayesian model-based approach in GA studies
abstract: In a typical Genetic Association Study (GAS) several hundreds to millions
  of genomic variables are measured and tested for association with a given set of
  a phenotypic variables (e.g., a given disease state or a complete expression profile),
  with the aim of identifying the genetic background of complex, multifactorial diseases.
  These highly varying requirements resulted in a number of different statistical
  tools applying different approaches either bayesian or non-bayesian, model-based
  or conditional. In this paper we evaluate dedicated GAS tools and general purpose
  feature subset selection (FSS) tools including a Bayesian model-based tool \emph{BMLA}
  in a GAS context. In the evaluation we used an artificial data set generated from
  a reference model with 113 genotypic variables that was based on a real-world genotype
  data.
