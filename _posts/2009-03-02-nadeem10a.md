title: Accuracy-Rejection Curves (ARCs) for Comparing Classification Methods with
  a Reject Option
abstract: Data extracted from microarrays are now considered an important source of
  knowledge about various diseases. Several studies based on microarray data and the
  use of receiver operating characteristics (ROC) graphs have compared supervised
  machine learning approaches. These comparisons are based on classification schemes
  in which all samples are classified, regardless of the degree of confidence associated
  with the classification of a particular sample on the basis of a given classifier.
  In the domain of healthcare, it is safer to refrain from classifying a sample if
  the confidence assigned to the classification is not high enough, rather than classifying
  all samples even if confidence is low. We describe an approach in which the performance
  of different classifiers is compared, with the possibility of rejection, based on
  several reject areas. Using a tradeoff between accuracy and rejection, we propose
  the use of accuracy-rejection curves (ARCs) and three types of relationship between
  ARCs for comparisons of the ARCs of two classifiers. Empirical results based on
  purely synthetic data, semi-synthetic data (generated from real data obtained from
  patients) and public microarray data for binary classification problems demonstrate
  the efficacy of this method.
