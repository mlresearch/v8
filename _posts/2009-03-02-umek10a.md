title: A Subgroup Discovery Approach for Relating Chemical Structure and Phenotype
  Data in Chemical Genomics
abstract: We report on development of an algorithm that can infer relations between
  the chemical structure and biochemical pathways from mutant-based growth fitness
  characterizations of small molecules. Identification of such relations is very important
  in drug discovery and development from the perspective of argument-based selection
  of candidate molecules in target-specific screenings, and early exclusion of substances
  with highly probable undesired side-effects. The algorithm uses a combination of
  unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques, and besides experimental
  fitness data uses knowledge on gene subgroups (pathways), structural descriptions
  of chemicals, and MeSH term-based chemical and pharmacological annotations. We demonstrate
  the utility of the proposed approach in the analysis of a genome-wide \emphS. cerevisiae
  chemogenomics assay by Hillenmeyer \emphet al. (Science, 2008).
