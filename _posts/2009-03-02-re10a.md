title: Simple ensemble methods are competitive with state-of-the-art data integration
  methods for gene function prediction
abstract: Several works showed that biomolecular data integration is a key issue to
  improve the prediction of gene functions. Quite surprisingly only little attention
  has been devoted to data integration for gene function prediction through ensemble
  methods. In this work we show that relatively simple ensemble methods are competitive
  and in some cases are also able to outperform state-of-the-art data integration
  techniques for gene function prediction.
