title: Hierarchical Cost-Sensitive Algorithms for Genome-Wide Gene Function Prediction
abstract: 'In this work we propose new ensemble methods for the hierarchical classification
  of gene functions. Our methods exploit the hierarchical relationships between the
  classes in different ways: each ensemble node is trained ``locally", according to
  its position in the hierarchy; moreover, in the evaluation phase the set of predicted
  annotations is built so to minimize a global loss function defined over the hierarchy.
  We also address the problem of sparsity of annotations by introducing a cost-sensitive
  parameter that allows to control the precision-recall trade-off. Experiments with
  the model organism \emph{ S. cerevisiae}, using the FunCat taxonomy and seven biomolecular
  data sets, reveal a significant advantage of our techniques over ``flat'''' and
  cost-insensitive hierarchical ensembles.'
