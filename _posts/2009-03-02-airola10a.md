title: A comparison of AUC estimators in small-sample studies
abstract: Reliable estimation of the classification performance of learned predictive
  models is difficult, when working in the small sample setting. When dealing with
  biological data it is often the case that separate test data cannot be afforded.
  Cross-validation is in this case a typical strategy for estimating the performance.
  Recent results, further supported by experimental evidence presented in this article,
  show that many standard approaches to cross-validation suffer from extensive bias
  or variance when the area under ROC curve (AUC) is used as performance measure.
  We advocate the use of leave-pair-out cross-validation (LPOCV) for performance estimation,
  as it avoids many of these problems. A method previously proposed by us can be used
  to efficiently calculate this estimate for regularized least-squares (RLS) based
  learners.
