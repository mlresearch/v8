title: Event based text mining for integrated network construction
abstract: The scientific literature is a rich and challenging data source for research
  in systems biology, providing numerous interactions between biological entities.  Text
  mining techniques have been increasingly useful to extract such information from
  the literature in an automatic way, but up to now the main focus of text mining
  in the systems biology field has been restricted mostly to the discovery of protein-protein
  interactions. Here, we take this approach one step further, and use machine learning
  techniques combined with text mining to extract a much wider variety of interactions
  between biological entities.  Each particular interaction type gives rise to a separate
  network, represented as a graph, all of which can be subsequently combined to yield
  a so-called integrated network representation. This provides a much broader view
  on the biological system as a whole, which can then be used in further investigations
  to analyse specific properties of the network.
