title: Predicting the functions of proteins in Protein-Protein Interaction networks
  from global information
abstract: In this work we present a novel approach to predict the function of proteins
  in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.  We classify existing approaches
  into inductive and transductive approaches, and into local and global approaches.  As
  of yet, among the group of inductive approaches, only local ones have been proposed
  for protein function prediction.  We here introduce a protein description formalism
  that also includes global information, namely information that locates a protein
  relative to specific important proteins in the network.  We analyze the effect on
  function prediction accuracy of selecting a different number of important proteins.  With
  around 70 important proteins, even in large graphs, our method makes good and stable
  predictions.  Furthermore, we investigate whether our method also classifies proteins
  accurately on more detailed function levels. We examined up to five different function
  levels.  The method is benchmarked on four datasets where we found classification
  performance according to F-measure values indeed improves by 9 percent over the
  benchmark methods employed.
