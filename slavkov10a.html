<h3>Abstract</h3>

In this paper we investigate the problem of evaluating ranked lists of
biomarkers, which are typically an output of the analysis of
high-throughput data. This can be a list of probes from microarray
experiments, which are ordered by the strength of their correlation to
a disease. Usually, the ordering of the biomarkers in the ranked lists
varies a lot if they are a result of different studies or methods. Our
work consists of two parts. First, we propose a method for evaluating
the "correctness" of the ranked lists. Second, we conduct a
preliminary study of different aggregation approaches of the feature
rankings, like aggregating rankings produced from different ranking
algorithms and different datasets. We perform experiments on multiple
public Neuroblastoma microarray studies. Our results show that there
is a generally beneficial effect of aggregating feature rankings as
compared to the ones produced by a single study or single method.
