<h3>Abstract</h3>

The scientific literature is a rich and challenging data source for
research in systems biology, providing numerous interactions between
biological entities.  Text mining techniques have been increasingly
useful to extract such information from the literature in an automatic
way, but up to now the main focus of text mining in the systems
biology field has been restricted mostly to the discovery of
protein-protein interactions. Here, we take this approach one step
further, and use machine learning techniques combined with text mining
to extract a much wider variety of interactions between biological
entities.  Each particular interaction type gives rise to a separate
network, represented as a graph, all of which can be subsequently
combined to yield a so-called integrated network representation. This
provides a much broader view on the biological system as a whole,
which can then be used in further investigations to analyse specific
properties of the network.
